# SQL Cyber Missions

A gamified SQL learning platform with emotionally responsive NPCs powered by Claude 3 Haiku and SEL principles.

## ðŸŽ® Project Overview

SQL Cyber Missions is an interactive educational game that teaches SQL through a hacker-themed storyline.  
Learners solve a series of SQL-based missions to track down a rogue hacker and protect digital infrastructure.
The platform integrates **Social and Emotional Learning (SEL)** to reduce frustration and increase engagement.  
Learners receive personalized support from three emotionally intelligent NPCs, powered by Claude 3 Haiku.



## Characters
- **Cipher** â€“ Offers SQL syntax and logic hints when an incorrect query is submitted.
- **Zen** â€“ Provides emotional support when frustration is detected (e.g., repeated deletions or long task time).
- **Phoebe** â€“ Offers praise and encouragement when effort is detected or after a blank/halted attempt.

```bash
